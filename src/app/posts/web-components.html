    <h3>What they are</h3>
    <p>A web component is the end result of combining a number of technologies together, namely:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom elements. An HTML/DOM API which allows authors to define and register custom tags with the browser. There are two "levels" to this; one is "autononmous elements", which stand alone and have their own tag name (e.g., <code><hm-datepicker></hm-datepicker></code></li>
    </ul>
