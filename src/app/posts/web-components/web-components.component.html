  <h2>Web Components</h2>
  <p>What they are, how they work, what support is like, and will your boss pay for them?</p>
  <h3>What they are</h3>
  <p>A web component is the end result of combining a number of technologies together, namely:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom elements. An HTML/DOM API which allows authors to define and register custom tags with the browser. There are two "levels" to this; one is "autononmous elements", which stand alone and have their own tag name (e.g., <code>&lt;hm-datepicker>&lt;/hm-datepicker></code></li>
  </ul>
